##################### data generated under mlbench.friedman1 ###################

# The mlbench::mlbench.friedman1() function is the regression problem Friedman 1,
# as described in Friedman (1991) and Breiman (1996). Inputs are 10 independent 
# variables uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1], only 5 out of the 10 
# covariates are actually used. The user specifies the number n of samples to be 
# generated, and the standard deviation of a standard Gaussian noise sequence 
# added to the simulated Y. 

# Found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datarobot/vignettes/VariableImportance.html
# "Based on the structure of this simulator, we may classify the covariates into 
# an influential subset (x1-x5), and an irrelevant subset (x6-x10). Also, from 
# the model coefficients and the functions involved, we expect x4 to be the 
# most important variable, probably followed by x1 and x2, both comparably 
# important, with x5 probably less important. The influence of x3 is somewhat 
# more difficult to assess due to its quadratic dependence, but it seems likely 
# that this nonlinearity will suppress this variableâ€™s influence since the total 
# range of this term is from 0 to 5, the same as the x5 term.
